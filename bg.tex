\chapter{Background}\label{chap:bg}

This chapter outlines the fundamental knowledge relevant to the work discussed in this thesis,
including concepts and definitions.
%
This chapter is divided into three sections.
%
\autoref{sec:ml} introduces machine learning~(ML) models designed for classification tasks. 
%
Specifically, our focus is on interpretable ML models, including decision sets, decision lists, and decision trees. 
%
In addition, we explore gradient boosted trees, which consist of a collection of decision trees,
and introduce neural networks.
%
In \autoref{sec:xai}, we offer a concise overview of the history of eXplainable AI~(XAI), 
with an emphasis on widely recognized model-agnostic techniques.
%
However, such methods suffer from various significant issues,
e.g., the unsoundness of explanations.
%
Therefore, in this section, we provide further insight into an emerging research field: formal
eXplainable AI~(FXAI), which seeks to overcome these drawbacks and prioritize the rigor of explanations.
%
\autoref{sec:sat} presents the concepts and definitions of Boolean satisfiability~(SAT) and maximum satisfiability~(MaxSAT), which serve as foundational elements for formal explainability. 
%
Furthermore, we introduce two other prevalent concepts in formal explainability, namely, Minimal Unsatisfiable Subset~(MUS) and Minimal Correction Subset~(MCS).
